    fall into the Dark Side and transform into iconic villain, Darth Vader.
    After the fall of the Republic and Jedi massacre at the end of the Clone
    Wars, Obi-Wan retreated to a desert planet named Tatooine. He stayed here
    to watch over one of Anakin's children, Luke Skywalker. He'd eventually
    join Luke to battle the Empire and sacrifice himself on the Death Star.
